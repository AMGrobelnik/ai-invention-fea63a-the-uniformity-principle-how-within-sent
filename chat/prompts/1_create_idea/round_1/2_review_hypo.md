<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Uniformity Improves Sentence Readability
hypothesis: >-
  The readability of a sentence is predicted not only by average linguistic complexity (e.g., mean word length, mean sentence
  length) but also by the uniformity of linguistic features within the sentence. Specifically, sentences with lower coefficient
  of variation (CV) of word-level features—such as word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency—are easier
  to read than sentences with the same average values but higher CV. This 'Uniformity Principle' operates because uniform
  information density allows readers to establish a consistent processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load compared to
  sentences with fluctuating complexity.
motivation: >-
  Classic readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) rely exclusively on average values of surface features. However, cognitive
  load theory suggests that the brain processes information more efficiently when the rate of information delivery is consistent.
  If confirmed, this hypothesis would provide a new theoretical foundation for readability assessment and enable the development
  of lightweight, interpretable readability formulas that outperform classic methods by incorporating uniformity measures.
  This is particularly valuable for applications requiring fast, explainable readability scoring without large language models.
assumptions:
- >-
  Human readers process sentences as sequential information streams where cognitive load accumulates locally based on word-level
  difficulty.
- >-
  Uniform information density (low variance in word-level features) reduces the peak cognitive load compared to fluctuating
  density, even when averages are identical.
- >-
  Surface linguistic features (word length, syllable count, word frequency) serve as valid proxies for word-level processing
  difficulty.
- >-
  The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) is an appropriate measure of uniformity that generalizes
  across sentences of different lengths and difficulty levels.
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Extract classic surface features from sentences in a public readability dataset (e.g., CommonLit CLEAR corpus or WSJ
  dataset): word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency for each word. 2. Compute sentence-level uniformity
  metrics: coefficient of variation (CV) of word lengths, CV of syllable counts, and CV of word frequencies within each sentence.
  3. Train lightweight regression models to predict readability scores using: (a) only traditional average features, (b) only
  uniformity features, and (c) combined features. 4. Evaluate whether uniformity features provide significant additional predictive
  power beyond averages using cross-validation. 5. Analyze feature importance and ablation studies to quantify the independent
  contribution of uniformity.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) Uniformity features (CV of word-level features) are statistically significant predictors
  of readability scores (p < 0.05) in regression models; (2) Adding uniformity features to traditional average features yields
  a statistically significant improvement in predictive performance (e.g., R² increase > 0.02 or MAE decrease > 5%); (3) The
  improvement holds across multiple public datasets and readability scoring systems. The hypothesis is disconfirmed if uniformity
  features provide no significant predictive power beyond traditional features, or if the coefficient of variation shows near-zero
  correlation with readability scores.
related_works:
- >-
  Feng et al. (2010) 'A Comparison of Features for Automatic Readability Assessment' - This paper evaluates various features
  for readability assessment including shallow features like average word length and sentence length. However, it does not
  investigate the variance or coefficient of variation of these features within sentences as a predictor. Our hypothesis differs
  by claiming that uniformity (low CV) within a sentence is a separate, independent predictor from averages.
- >-
  Courtis (2004) 'Corporate report obfuscation: artefact or phenomenon?' - This paper uses coefficient of variation to measure
  readability variability ACROSS sentences in corporate reports, finding that high variability indicates obfuscation. Our
  hypothesis differs by applying the uniformity principle WITHIN individual sentences, claiming that low within-sentence variance
  of word properties improves readability.
- >-
  Eltanbouly et al. (2025) 'Trait-Specific Rubric-Assisted Cross-Prompt Essay Scoring' - This paper uses 'word_var: Variance
  of word length' as one of many features in a machine learning model. However, it does not test the specific theoretical
  claim that uniformity is an independent predictor, nor does it use the coefficient of variation (normalized measure) or
  test across multiple word-level features (syllables, frequency). Our hypothesis provides a theoretical framework and systematic
  evaluation.
- >-
  Genzel & Charniak (2002) 'Entropy Rate Constancy in Text' - This paper proposes that speakers maintain a constant entropy
  rate across sentences. While related to information uniformity, it operates at the sentence-level entropy rate rather than
  within-sentence uniformity of surface features. Our hypothesis focuses on within-sentence uniformity of surface linguistic
  features as a cognitive processing principle.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by three cross-domain insights: (1) From COGNITIVE SCIENCE and Cognitive Load Theory: consistent
  information processing rates reduce peak working memory load compared to fluctuating rates. (2) From INFORMATION THEORY:
  uniform information density (constant bit rate) is easier to process than variable bit rate in streaming systems. (3) From
  ECONOMICS: the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation measure inequality/non-uniformity, which in other domains predicts
  system efficiency. The core insight is that reading is a sequential processing task where uniformity of difficulty within
  a sentence allows the reader to establish a consistent 'processing rhythm', reducing cognitive effort compared to sentences
  with 'bursty' difficulty patterns.
terms:
- term: Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  definition: >-
    A normalized measure of dispersion calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (CV = σ/μ). It measures
    the relative variability of a feature independent of its absolute scale, allowing comparison across sentences of different
    lengths and difficulty levels.
- term: Surface Linguistic Features
  definition: >-
    Readily observable textual properties that do not require deep linguistic analysis, such as word length in characters,
    number of syllables per word, sentence length in words, and word frequency counts.
- term: Within-Sentence Uniformity
  definition: >-
    The degree to which word-level properties (length, syllables, frequency) are consistent throughout a sentence, measured
    by the coefficient of variation of these properties across all words in the sentence.
- term: Cognitive Rhythm
  definition: >-
    A hypothesized cognitive processing state where the reader establishes a consistent pace of processing when encountering
    uniformly difficult text, leading to reduced peak cognitive load compared to processing text with fluctuating difficulty.
- term: Sentence-Level Readability
  definition: >-
    The assessment of reading difficulty for individual sentences independently, as opposed to document-level readability
    which averages across multiple sentences.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes that sentence readability depends not only on average linguistic complexity but also on the uniformity
  of word-level features within the sentence. Sentences with consistent word lengths, syllable counts, and word frequencies
  (low coefficient of variation) are predicted to be easier to read because they allow readers to maintain a steady cognitive
  processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for judging whether the hypothesis is genuinely novel versus already-done or a known dead end in this field.

<task>
Provide a thorough peer review of this research hypothesis.

STEP 1 — GROUND YOUR REVIEW IN EVIDENCE:
Before writing critiques, search for relevant context to make your review authoritative:
- Search for accepted papers at top venues in this area — what level of
  contribution gets accepted? How does this hypothesis compare?
- Search for the closest existing work — is this genuinely novel or incremental?
- Check if the proposed methodology has known failure modes in the literature

STEP 2 — WRITE YOUR REVIEW:
For each critique:
1. Categorize: methodology, evidence, novelty, clarity, scope, or rigor
2. Rate severity: major (would waste compute if not fixed) or minor (polish)
3. Describe the issue clearly
4. Suggest a concrete action to address it

Focus on the most impactful issues. Flag fatal flaws that would waste compute if not fixed first.

STABILITY IS OK: If the hypothesis is on track and just needs more iterations to prove itself,
keep your feedback similar to the previous round. Don't manufacture new critiques — only escalate
when the revision introduced new issues or failed to address prior ones.

STEP 3 — H↔H EDGE:
This is the first iteration — there is no previous hypothesis. Leave
``relation_type`` null and ``relation_rationale`` empty.

Provide your review via structured output.

description: "Comprehensive web research toolkit — use whenever a task needs MORE than a handful of WebSearch/WebFetch calls (multi-source literature reviews, deep verification across many pages, paper/PDF mining, cross-referencing claims, building bibliographies). Not for single quick lookups — use raw WebSearch/WebFetch for those. Adds aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact regex extraction over HTML or PDFs (arXiv, journals) with context windows, beyond what WebFetch's lossy summary returns. Trigger: any extensive/comprehensive/deep research task, literature review, multi-source investigation, verify many citations, arxiv, paper, PDF, exact quote, methodology, table value, regex."
---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-research-tools"
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
