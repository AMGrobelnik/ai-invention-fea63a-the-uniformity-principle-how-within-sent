<current_hypothesis>
The hypothesis as it stands. Revise it based on the evidence below.

kind: hypothesis
title: Uniformity Improves Sentence Readability
hypothesis: >-
  The readability of a sentence is predicted not only by average linguistic complexity (e.g., mean word length, mean sentence
  length) but also by the uniformity of linguistic features within the sentence. Specifically, sentences with lower coefficient
  of variation (CV) of word-level features—such as word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency—are easier
  to read than sentences with the same average values but higher CV. This 'Uniformity Principle' operates because uniform
  information density allows readers to establish a consistent processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load compared to
  sentences with fluctuating complexity.
motivation: >-
  Classic readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) rely exclusively on average values of surface features. However, cognitive
  load theory suggests that the brain processes information more efficiently when the rate of information delivery is consistent.
  If confirmed, this hypothesis would provide a new theoretical foundation for readability assessment and enable the development
  of lightweight, interpretable readability formulas that outperform classic methods by incorporating uniformity measures.
  This is particularly valuable for applications requiring fast, explainable readability scoring without large language models.
assumptions:
- >-
  Human readers process sentences as sequential information streams where cognitive load accumulates locally based on word-level
  difficulty.
- >-
  Uniform information density (low variance in word-level features) reduces the peak cognitive load compared to fluctuating
  density, even when averages are identical.
- >-
  Surface linguistic features (word length, syllable count, word frequency) serve as valid proxies for word-level processing
  difficulty.
- >-
  The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) is an appropriate measure of uniformity that generalizes
  across sentences of different lengths and difficulty levels.
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Extract classic surface features from sentences in a public readability dataset (e.g., CommonLit CLEAR corpus or WSJ
  dataset): word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency for each word. 2. Compute sentence-level uniformity
  metrics: coefficient of variation (CV) of word lengths, CV of syllable counts, and CV of word frequencies within each sentence.
  3. Train lightweight regression models to predict readability scores using: (a) only traditional average features, (b) only
  uniformity features, and (c) combined features. 4. Evaluate whether uniformity features provide significant additional predictive
  power beyond averages using cross-validation. 5. Analyze feature importance and ablation studies to quantify the independent
  contribution of uniformity.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) Uniformity features (CV of word-level features) are statistically significant predictors
  of readability scores (p < 0.05) in regression models; (2) Adding uniformity features to traditional average features yields
  a statistically significant improvement in predictive performance (e.g., R² increase > 0.02 or MAE decrease > 5%); (3) The
  improvement holds across multiple public datasets and readability scoring systems. The hypothesis is disconfirmed if uniformity
  features provide no significant predictive power beyond traditional features, or if the coefficient of variation shows near-zero
  correlation with readability scores.

  Feng et al. (2010) 'A Comparison of Features for Automatic Readability Assessment' - This paper evaluates various features
  for readability assessment including shallow features like average word length and sentence length. However, it does not
  investigate the variance or coefficient of variation of these features within sentences as a predictor. Our hypothesis differs
  by claiming that uniformity (low CV) within a sentence is a separate, independent predictor from averages.
- >-
  Courtis (2004) 'Corporate report obfuscation: artefact or phenomenon?' - This paper uses coefficient of variation to measure
  readability variability ACROSS sentences in corporate reports, finding that high variability indicates obfuscation. Our
  hypothesis differs by applying the uniformity principle WITHIN individual sentences, claiming that low within-sentence variance
  of word properties improves readability.
- >-
  Eltanbouly et al. (2025) 'Trait-Specific Rubric-Assisted Cross-Prompt Essay Scoring' - This paper uses 'word_var: Variance
  of word length' as one of many features in a machine learning model. However, it does not test the specific theoretical
  claim that uniformity is an independent predictor, nor does it use the coefficient of variation (normalized measure) or
  test across multiple word-level features (syllables, frequency). Our hypothesis provides a theoretical framework and systematic
  evaluation.
- >-
  Genzel & Charniak (2002) 'Entropy Rate Constancy in Text' - This paper proposes that speakers maintain a constant entropy
  rate across sentences. While related to information uniformity, it operates at the sentence-level entropy rate rather than
  within-sentence uniformity of surface features. Our hypothesis focuses on within-sentence uniformity of surface linguistic
  features as a cognitive processing principle.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by three cross-domain insights: (1) From COGNITIVE SCIENCE and Cognitive Load Theory: consistent
  information processing rates reduce peak working memory load compared to fluctuating rates. (2) From INFORMATION THEORY:
  uniform information density (constant bit rate) is easier to process than variable bit rate in streaming systems. (3) From
  ECONOMICS: the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation measure inequality/non-uniformity, which in other domains predicts
  system efficiency. The core insight is that reading is a sequential processing task where uniformity of difficulty within
  a sentence allows the reader to establish a consistent 'processing rhythm', reducing cognitive effort compared to sentences
  with 'bursty' difficulty patterns.
terms:
- term: Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  definition: >-
    A normalized measure of dispersion calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (CV = σ/μ). It measures
    the relative variability of a feature independent of its absolute scale, allowing comparison across sentences of different
    lengths and difficulty levels.
- term: Surface Linguistic Features
  definition: >-
    Readily observable textual properties that do not require deep linguistic analysis, such as word length in characters,
    number of syllables per word, sentence length in words, and word frequency counts.
- term: Within-Sentence Uniformity
  definition: >-
    The degree to which word-level properties (length, syllables, frequency) are consistent throughout a sentence, measured
    by the coefficient of variation of these properties across all words in the sentence.
- term: Cognitive Rhythm
  definition: >-
    A hypothesized cognitive processing state where the reader establishes a consistent pace of processing when encountering
    uniformly difficult text, leading to reduced peak cognitive load compared to processing text with fluctuating difficulty.
- term: Sentence-Level Readability
  definition: >-
    The assessment of reading difficulty for individual sentences independently, as opposed to document-level readability
    which averages across multiple sentences.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes that sentence readability depends not only on average linguistic complexity but also on the uniformity
  of word-level features within the sentence. Sentences with consistent word lengths, syllable counts, and word frequencies
  (low coefficient of variation) are predicted to be easier to read because they allow readers to maintain a steady cognitive
  processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load.

# The Uniformity Principle: How Within-Sentence Consistency Predicts Readability

## Abstract

Classic readability formulas (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) rely exclusively on average values of surface linguistic features. This paper introduces the Uniformity Principle: readability is predicted not only by these averages but also by the uniformity (consistent difficulty) of word-level features within a sentence. We evaluate this hypothesis on 13,129 sentences from two public benchmarks (WeeBIT and CEFR-SP). Using Ridge regression with 5-fold cross-validation, we find that uniformity features (coefficient of variation of word length, syllable count, and word frequency) are statistically significant predictors of readability scores (p < 0.001), yielding R-squared improvements of +0.138 and +0.042 beyond traditional average features. The coefficient of variation of syllable counts is the most predictive uniformity feature (coefficient +0.150 on WeeBIT). These findings suggest that the Uniformity Principle captures a previously unrecognized aspect of readability, providing a lightweight and interpretable enhancement to traditional readability assessment.

# 1 Introduction

Readability assessment—the task of predicting how difficult a text is to read—has practical applications in education, content creation, and accessibility. Classic readability formulas such as Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level operate by computing averages of surface linguistic features: average word length in characters, average sentence length in words, and average syllables per word. These formulas assume that a sentence's difficulty can be reduced to its mean properties.

However, reading is a sequential information processing task. Cognitive load theory suggests that the human brain processes information more efficiently when the rate of information delivery is consistent. In streaming systems, uniform bit rate is easier to decode than variable bit rate. Similarly, in economics, inequality measures like the Gini coefficient predict system efficiency. We hypothesize that a similar principle applies to reading: sentences with uniform word-level difficulty allow readers to establish a consistent processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load compared to sentences with bursty difficulty patterns.

We call this the **Uniformity Principle**: the readability of a sentence is predicted not only by average linguistic complexity but also by the uniformity (consistency) of linguistic features within the sentence. Specifically, we propose that sentences with lower coefficient of variation (CV = standard deviation / mean) of word-level features are easier to read than sentences with the same average values but higher CV.

[FIGURE:fig1]

This paper makes the following contributions:

1. **Theoretical contribution**: We formulate the Uniformity Principle as a novel predictor of sentence-level readability, grounded in cognitive load theory and information theory.
2. **Empirical evaluation**: We conduct a systematic evaluation on 13,129 sentences from two established benchmarks (WeeBIT and CEFR-SP).
3. **Significant findings**: We show that uniformity features provide statistically significant predictive power beyond traditional features (p < 0.001), with R-squared improvements of +0.138 and +0.042.
4. **Practical impact**: The Uniformity Principle enables lightweight, interpretable readability formulas that outperform classic methods.

# 2 Related Work

## 2.1 Readability Assessment

Readability assessment has a long history in natural language processing. Classic formulas rely on shallow surface features. Feng et al. conducted a comprehensive comparison of features for automatic readability assessment, evaluating discourse, language modeling, syntactic, part-of-speech, and shallow features. Their Table 5 lists 8 shallow features, all of which are means or averages. To our knowledge, no prior work has investigated the variance or coefficient of variation of these features within sentences as a predictor of readability.

## 2.2 Variance and Uniformity in Text

Courtis used the coefficient of variation to measure readability variability across sentences in corporate reports. However, this work operates at the document level. Our hypothesis is fundamentally different: we claim that within-sentence uniformity of word properties improves readability.

## 2.3 Cognitive Load Theory

Cognitive load theory posits that working memory has limited capacity. In reading, cognitive load accumulates locally based on word-level difficulty. We hypothesize that uniform information density reduces peak cognitive load.

---

# 3 The Uniformity Principle

## 3.1 Hypothesis

The Uniformity Principle states that sentence readability depends not only on average linguistic complexity but also on the uniformity of word-level features within the sentence.

Formally, for a word-level feature f, we define: (1) Average: μf = (1/n) Σ fi, (2) Uniformity (CV): CVf = σf / μf.

The Uniformity Principle predicts that readability score R is a function of both μf and CVf.

## 3.2 Cognitive Motivation

The hypothesis is motivated by: (1) Cognitive Load Theory—consistent processing reduces peak load, (2) Information Theory—uniform bit rate is easier to decode, (3) Gini Coefficient—inequality reduces efficiency.

## 3.3 Feature Definitions

We compute three classes of word-level features: (1) Word length in characters, (2) Syllable count (using CMU Pronouncing Dictionary), (3) Word frequency (log-transformed, from NLTK Gutenberg corpus). For each feature, we compute: Average (traditional) and Coefficient of variation (uniformity).

---

# 4 Experiments

## 4.1 Datasets

We evaluate on two public sentence-level readability datasets.

**WeeBIT**: 3,125 sentences annotated with 5 age intervals. Scores normalized to [0, 1].

**CEFR-SP**: 10,004 sentences annotated with CEFR levels (A1-C2). Levels mapped to 0.0-1.0.

[FIGURE:fig2]

## 4.2 Experimental Setup

Feature computation: Syllable counting uses CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (123,455 words). Word frequency uses NLTK Gutenberg corpus (42,339 words). Models: Ridge regression (alpha=1.0) with 5-fold cross-validation. Three feature sets: (1) Average only, (2) Uniformity only, (3) Combined.

## 4.3 Results

[FIGURE:fig3]

Key findings: (1) Uniformity features are predictive (R² > 0.22 on WeeBIT, > 0.40 on CEFR-SP), (2) Adding uniformity features yields significant improvements (p < 0.001), (3) MSE reduction of 17.8% (WeeBIT) and 8.9% (CEFR-SP).

## 4.4 Feature Importance

[FIGURE:fig4]

All three uniformity features have positive coefficients, indicating that higher within-sentence variance is associated with higher reading difficulty. On WeeBIT, top features: cv_syllables (+0.150), avg_word_len (-0.117), num_words (+0.108), cv_freq (+0.103).

---

# 5 Discussion

## 5.1 Interpretation of Results

The results confirm the Uniformity Principle hypothesis. The effect is particularly strong for cv_syllables (+0.150 on WeeBIT), suggesting sentences with varying syllable counts are more difficult.

## 5.2 Comparison to Classic Formulas

Classic readability formulas can be viewed as linear combinations of average features. Our results suggest these formulas are incomplete—they miss the uniformity signal that explains an additional 1.8-13.8% of variance.

## 5.3 Limitations

Word frequency uses Gutenberg corpus (not SUBTLEX-US). WeeBIT has only 5 readability levels. No direct cognitive validation (eye-tracking data).



[FIGURE:fig5]

## 5.4 Practical Applications

The Uniformity Principle enables: (1) Lightweight readability scoring, (2) Text simplification guidance, (3) Curriculum design.

---

# 6 Conclusion

This paper introduced the Uniformity Principle: the hypothesis that within-sentence uniformity of word-level linguistic features predicts readability independently of traditional average features. Through systematic evaluation on 13,129 sentences from two public benchmarks, we demonstrated that uniformity features are statistically significant predictors (p < 0.001), adding uniformity features yields R² improvements of +0.138 and +0.042, and the coefficient of variation of syllable counts is the most predictive uniformity feature.

These findings suggest that the Uniformity Principle captures a previously unrecognized aspect of readability. We hope this work inspires further research into uniformity-based features for readability assessment.

<reviewer_feedback>
Feedback from the paper reviewer this iteration.

- [MAJOR] (methodology) The paper uses NLTK Gutenberg corpus for word frequency computation, which the authors' own research artifact (art_zKX1_wXmedjn) identifies as suboptimal. The artifact states: 'SUBTLEX-US norms (based on 51M subtitle words) significantly outperform older norms (Kucera & Francis, Celex) in predicting word processing times.' Using Gutenberg corpus (42,339 words from books) instead of SUBTLEX-US likely reduces the quality of the frequency-based uniformity features.
  Action: Replace NLTK Gutenberg corpus with SUBTLEX-US word frequency norms. The SUBTLEX-US data is freely available from Ghent University. Use the Zipf scale values or SUBTL WF (word frequency per million) for computing word frequency uniformity. This change is straightforward and will improve the quality of the frequency features.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The paper only uses Ridge regression as the evaluation model. This is a weak baseline that does not represent the current state of readability assessment. Recent work (Deutsch et al. 2020, Liu & Lee 2023) has shown that neural models and comprehensive feature sets (e.g., LingFeat with 255 features) achieve much higher performance. Without comparing to these stronger baselines, it's unclear whether uniformity features provide value beyond what's already captured by modern methods.
  Action: Add experiments with at least one modern neural baseline (e.g., BERT-based readability assessment) and one comprehensive feature-based baseline (e.g., LingFeat or the feature set from Deutsch et al. 2020). Show whether adding uniformity features to these stronger baselines still yields improvements. If the improvement disappears with stronger baselines, the contribution is much weaker than claimed.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) The paper reports R² improvements of +0.138 and +0.042 but does not provide effect sizes, confidence intervals, or detailed breakdown of these improvements. The p-values (< 0.001) are reported but p-values alone are insufficient for evaluating practical significance. Additionally, the paper claims 'MSE reduction of 17.8% (WeeBIT) and 8.9% (CEFR-SP)' but it's unclear whether this is on training or test set, and whether the reduction is statistically significant.
  Action: Report cross-validated R² differences with bootstrap confidence intervals (as recommended in the research artifact). Provide a table with mean, standard deviation, and confidence intervals for R² on test sets for all three feature sets (average only, uniformity only, combined). Also report whether the MSE reduction is statistically significant using a paired bootstrap test.
- [MINOR] (novelty) The paper states 'To our knowledge, no prior work has investigated the variance or coefficient of variation of these features within sentences as a predictor of readability.' While this appears true for word-level features, the paper should acknowledge that Courtis (1998) investigated readability VARIABILITY at the document level (using coefficient of variation across sentences in corporate reports). The paper correctly distinguishes this but could be more explicit about the relationship to this prior work.
  Action: In Section 2.2, add a more detailed discussion of Courtis (1998) and explicitly state that while Courtis operated at the document level (variance across sentences), this paper is the first to investigate within-sentence variance of word-level features. This strengthens rather than weakens the paper's novelty claim.
- [MAJOR] (scope) The evaluation is limited to only 2 sentence-level datasets (WeeBIT and CEFR-SP). Both datasets have limitations: WeeBIT has only 5 readability levels and was originally designed for document-level assessment; CEFR-SP sentences are annotated based on document-level CEFR ratings, not direct sentence-level annotation. The generalizability of the results to other datasets, to document-level readability, and to languages other than English is not established.
  Action: Add evaluation on at least one more dataset, preferably at the document level (e.g., CLEAR corpus or Newsela). If document-level evaluation is not possible, at least add evaluation on a third sentence-level dataset (e.g., WSJ dataset from Liu & Lee 2023). Also discuss the limitations of the current evaluation more explicitly in Section 5.3.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The paper does not report out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates for the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary. The research artifact mentions that CMUdict has 123,455 words, but typical readability assessment texts may contain words not in this dictionary (e.g., domain-specific terms, named entities, rare words). The handling of OOV words for syllable counting and the OOV rate should be reported.
  Action: Report the OOV rate for CMUdict on both datasets. Implement and document a fallback strategy for OOV words (e.g., using the 'syllables' package heuristic or a simple rule like counting vowel groups). Sensitivity analysis showing the impact of OOV handling on results would further strengthen the paper.
- [MINOR] (clarity) Figure references (FIGURE:fig1 through FIGURE:fig5) are placeholders without actual figures or detailed captions. While the instructions state that figures should be assumed to show exactly what the caption describes, having no figures or detailed captions makes it difficult to evaluate whether the results are presented clearly and whether the figures effectively communicate the findings.
  Action: Generate actual figures or provide detailed figure captions specifying what each figure shows, what the axes are, what the error bars represent, etc. At minimum, provide mock-ups or detailed descriptions of what each figure should contain so that reviewers can evaluate whether the visualization effectively communicates the results.
- [MINOR] (methodology) Section 4.2 states that syllable counting uses CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (123,455 words) and word frequency uses NLTK Gutenberg corpus (42,339 words), but it's unclear how word frequency is computed for out-of-vocabulary words (words not in Gutenberg). Are they assigned a default frequency? Removed? This should be documented.
  Action: Document the handling of OOV words for word frequency computation. If using a default frequency for OOV words, justify the choice (e.g., assigning frequency = 0 or 1 for unseen words). If removing OOV words, report the percentage of words removed and show that results are robust to this choice.
- [MINOR] (evidence) The paper reports positive coefficients for all three uniformity features, indicating that higher within-sentence variance is associated with higher reading difficulty. This is plausible but the paper does not provide error bars or significance tests for individual feature coefficients. It's possible that some uniformity features are not significant predictors when controlling for others.
  Action: Add a table or discussion of the statistical significance of individual feature coefficients. Report standard errors or confidence intervals for the Ridge regression coefficients. This will help readers understand which uniformity features are most robust and whether all three contribute uniquely to predictability.
- [MINOR] (scope) The paper claims practical applications in 'Lightweight readability scoring, Text simplification guidance, Curriculum design' (Section 5.4) but does not demonstrate or evaluate any of these applications. The paper is purely an empirical evaluation of whether uniformity features predict readability, without demonstrating end-to-end utility.
  Action: Either add a demonstration of one practical application (e.g., show how uniformity features can guide text simplification by identifying sentences with high CV that should be simplified) or tone down the claims about practical applications in Section 5.4. A short demonstration or case study would substantially strengthen the paper.

<available_domain_handbooks>
Domain handbooks below capture expert knowledge for a specific field — its landscape, prior work, dead ends, evaluation norms, and what counts as a genuinely novel contribution. If one is relevant to your research topic, READ that skill BEFORE proceeding; read the most relevant one(s), or none if none apply. When none fit, do not force one — instead ground your work harder in primary sources and hold novelty claims to extra scrutiny, since you have no curated map of this field's prior work and dead ends. Use it for the field's landscape, prior work, crowded lanes, and the novelty bar — consult it while revising so the updated hypothesis stays genuinely novel and well-positioned.

<task>
IMPORTANT: Your ONLY output is the revised hypothesis text. Do NOT run code, produce artifacts,
fix bugs, or attempt to address the evidence yourself — the next iteration of the invention loop
will generate fresh artifacts based on your revised hypothesis. Reflect and rewrite; nothing else.

Do NOT generate a completely new hypothesis. Take the current hypothesis and REVISE it
to incorporate new evidence. Keep the core idea — refine, narrow, or strengthen it.

1. Does the evidence support the hypothesis? Narrow or broaden scope as needed.
2. Which claims now have strong evidence? Which are still unsupported?
3. Should the hypothesis become more specific based on what we've learned?
4. If reviewer feedback is provided, address the critiques directly.

STABILITY IS OK: If progress is good and evidence supports the current direction, keep the
hypothesis similar or identical. Only make substantive changes when evidence clearly calls for
them — e.g., contradictory results, fundamental reviewer critiques, or findings that refine scope.

You must also classify two kinds of edges in the research trace:

(A) The H↔H edge — how does this revised hypothesis relate to the previous one?
    Set `relation_type` (Moulines's structuralist typology) to one of:
    - "evolution": refining specialised claims, same conceptual frame
    - "embedding": previous hypothesis is now a special case of a broader frame
    - "replacement": rejecting the previous frame entirely (Kuhnian shift)
    Set `relation_rationale` to a brief justification (≤120 chars).

(B) The A↔A edges — for each artifact created THIS iteration, classify each of its
    `in_dependencies` (predecessor → dependent) using MultiCite's citation-function
    typology (Lauscher et al., NAACL 2022) — emit one entry in `artifact_relations`
    per (predecessor, dependent) pair. Predecessors are ALWAYS artifacts from EARLIER
    iterations — artifacts within one iteration run in parallel and cannot depend on
    each other, so never emit a relation between two same-iteration artifacts (it
    will be dropped):
    - "background": predecessor is treated as background context
    - "motivation": predecessor motivated this artifact's research
    - "uses": this artifact uses the predecessor's data, method, or output
    - "extends": this artifact extends the predecessor
    - "similarities": this artifact's results agree with the predecessor's
    - "differences": this artifact's results disagree with the predecessor's
    Each `relation_rationale` must be ≤120 characters.

Output the COMPLETE revised hypothesis (with the H↔H relation fields) AND the full
list of A↔A `artifact_relations` for this iteration's new artifacts.
