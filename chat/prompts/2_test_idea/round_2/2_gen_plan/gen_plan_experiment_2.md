<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Uniformity Improves Sentence Readability
hypothesis: >-
  The readability of a sentence is predicted not only by average linguistic complexity (e.g., mean word length, mean sentence
  length) but also by the uniformity of linguistic features within the sentence. Specifically, sentences with lower coefficient
  of variation (CV) of word-level features—such as word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency—are easier
  to read than sentences with the same average values but higher CV. Initial experiments on 13,129 sentences from WeeBIT and
  CEFR-SP datasets show that adding uniformity features (CV of word length, syllables, frequency) to traditional average features
  yields statistically significant R² improvements of +0.138 (WeeBIT) and +0.042 (CEFR-SP), both p < 0.0001. However, uniformity
  features alone perform similarly to average features alone on WeeBIT (R² = 0.226 vs 0.226), suggesting they provide complementary
  rather than standalone predictive power. The 'Uniformity Principle' operates because uniform information density allows
  readers to establish a consistent processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load. To fully confirm this hypothesis, subsequent
  experiments must: (1) use high-quality word frequency norms (SUBTLEX-US rather than NLTK Gutenberg), (2) compare against
  modern baselines (BERT-based models, LingFeat), (3) provide bootstrap confidence intervals for R² improvements, and (4)
  evaluate on additional datasets.
motivation: >-
  Classic readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) rely exclusively on average values of surface features. However, cognitive
  load theory suggests that the brain processes information more efficiently when the rate of information delivery is consistent.
  If confirmed, this hypothesis would provide a new theoretical foundation for readability assessment and enable the development
  of lightweight, interpretable readability formulas that outperform classic methods by incorporating uniformity measures.
  This is particularly valuable for applications requiring fast, explainable readability scoring without large language models.
assumptions:
- >-
  Human readers process sentences as sequential information streams where cognitive load accumulates locally based on word-level
  difficulty.
- >-
  Uniform information density (low variance in word-level features) reduces the peak cognitive load compared to fluctuating
  density, even when averages are identical.
- >-
  Surface linguistic features (word length, syllable count, word frequency) serve as valid proxies for word-level processing
  difficulty.
- >-
  The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) is an appropriate measure of uniformity that generalizes
  across sentences of different lengths and difficulty levels.
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Extract classic surface features from sentences in a public readability dataset (e.g., CommonLit CLEAR corpus or WSJ
  dataset): word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency for each word. 2. Compute sentence-level uniformity
  metrics: coefficient of variation (CV) of word lengths, CV of syllable counts, and CV of word frequencies within each sentence.
  3. Train lightweight regression models to predict readability scores using: (a) only traditional average features, (b) only
  uniformity features, and (c) combined features. 4. Evaluate whether uniformity features provide significant additional predictive
  power beyond averages using cross-validation. 5. Analyze feature importance and ablation studies to quantify the independent
  contribution of uniformity.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) Uniformity features (CV of word-level features) are statistically significant predictors
  of readability scores (p < 0.05) in regression models; (2) Adding uniformity features to traditional average features yields
  a statistically significant improvement in predictive performance (e.g., R² increase > 0.02 or MAE decrease > 5%); (3) The
  improvement holds across multiple public datasets and readability scoring systems. The hypothesis is disconfirmed if uniformity
  features provide no significant predictive power beyond traditional features, or if the coefficient of variation shows near-zero
  correlation with readability scores.

  Feng et al. (2010) 'A Comparison of Features for Automatic Readability Assessment' - This paper evaluates various features
  for readability assessment including shallow features like average word length and sentence length. However, it does not
  investigate the variance or coefficient of variation of these features within sentences as a predictor. Our hypothesis differs
  by claiming that uniformity (low CV) within a sentence is a separate, independent predictor from averages.
- >-
  Courtis (2004) 'Corporate report obfuscation: artefact or phenomenon?' - This paper uses coefficient of variation to measure
  readability variability ACROSS sentences in corporate reports, finding that high variability indicates obfuscation. Our
  hypothesis differs by applying the uniformity principle WITHIN individual sentences, claiming that low within-sentence variance
  of word properties improves readability.
- >-
  Eltanbouly et al. (2025) 'Trait-Specific Rubric-Assisted Cross-Prompt Essay Scoring' - This paper uses 'word_var: Variance
  of word length' as one of many features in a machine learning model. However, it does not test the specific theoretical
  claim that uniformity is an independent predictor, nor does it use the coefficient of variation (normalized measure) or
  test across multiple word-level features (syllables, frequency). Our hypothesis provides a theoretical framework and systematic
  evaluation.
- >-
  Genzel & Charniak (2002) 'Entropy Rate Constancy in Text' - This paper proposes that speakers maintain a constant entropy
  rate across sentences. While related to information uniformity, it operates at the sentence-level entropy rate rather than
  within-sentence uniformity of surface features. Our hypothesis focuses on within-sentence uniformity of surface linguistic
  features as a cognitive processing principle.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by three cross-domain insights: (1) From COGNITIVE SCIENCE and Cognitive Load Theory: consistent
  information processing rates reduce peak working memory load compared to fluctuating rates. (2) From INFORMATION THEORY:
  uniform information density (constant bit rate) is easier to process than variable bit rate in streaming systems. (3) From
  ECONOMICS: the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation measure inequality/non-uniformity, which in other domains predicts
  system efficiency. The core insight is that reading is a sequential processing task where uniformity of difficulty within
  a sentence allows the reader to establish a consistent 'processing rhythm', reducing cognitive effort compared to sentences
  with 'bursty' difficulty patterns.
terms:
- term: Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  definition: >-
    A normalized measure of dispersion calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (CV = σ/μ). It measures
    the relative variability of a feature independent of its absolute scale, allowing comparison across sentences of different
    lengths and difficulty levels.
- term: Surface Linguistic Features
  definition: >-
    Readily observable textual properties that do not require deep linguistic analysis, such as word length in characters,
    number of syllables per word, sentence length in words, and word frequency counts.
- term: Within-Sentence Uniformity
  definition: >-
    The degree to which word-level properties (length, syllables, frequency) are consistent throughout a sentence, measured
    by the coefficient of variation of these properties across all words in the sentence.
- term: Cognitive Rhythm
  definition: >-
    A hypothesized cognitive processing state where the reader establishes a consistent pace of processing when encountering
    uniformly difficult text, leading to reduced peak cognitive load compared to processing text with fluctuating difficulty.
- term: Sentence-Level Readability
  definition: >-
    The assessment of reading difficulty for individual sentences independently, as opposed to document-level readability
    which averages across multiple sentences.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes that sentence readability depends not only on average linguistic complexity but also on the uniformity
  of word-level features within the sentence. Sentences with consistent word lengths, syllable counts, and word frequencies
  (low coefficient of variation) are predicted to be easier to read because they allow readers to maintain a steady cognitive
  processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load.

approach: >-
  Implement statistical evaluation using the experiment results: (1) Paired Bootstrap Test: Test whether MSE reduction (17.8%
  WeeBIT, 8.9% CEFR-SP) is statistically significant using 10,000 bootstrap samples with p-value computation. (2) Feature
  Coefficient Uncertainty: Bootstrap standard errors and 95% CI for Ridge regression coefficients, identify which uniformity
  features are significant when controlling for others. (3) Proper Reporting: Clearly distinguish training vs test metrics,
  report cross-validated test set results only. (4) Effect Size: Compute Cohen's d for R² improvements, assess practical significance.
  (5) Ablation: Test each uniformity feature individually to identify which contribute uniquely. Generate publication-ready
  tables with mean, SD, CI for all metrics. This addresses major feedback #3 (statistical rigor) and minor feedback #9 (coefficient
  significance).

title: Word features and readability methods research
summary: |-
  This research artifact provides a comprehensive methodological guide for computing word-level linguistic features (syllable count, word frequency) and understanding the sentence-level readability assessment landscape. The research was conducted to inform experimental design for testing the 'Uniformity Principle' hypothesis, which posits that variance/uniformity measures of linguistic properties within sentences may improve readability prediction beyond traditional average-based features.

  Key findings across 5 research phases:

  1. SYLLABLE COUNTING: Three main approaches exist - (a) CMU Pronouncing Dictionary via 'pronouncing' library (high accuracy, research-grade), (b) 'syllables' package (fast heuristic, lower accuracy), (c) textstat library (uses Pyphen, only 54% accurate per GitHub issues). Recommendation: Use CMUdict as primary with heuristic fallback.

  2. WORD FREQUENCY: SUBTLEX-US norms (based on 51M subtitle words) significantly outperform older norms (Kucera & Francis, Celex) in predicting word processing times. Available as free download from Ghent University. Google Books Ngrams is secondary option.

  3. SENTENCE-LEVEL DATASETS: (a) CLEAR corpus (~5,000 excerpts, grades 3-12, multiple readability metrics + teacher ratings, MIT license), (b) WSJ dataset (1,200 sentences, 20 annotators, grades 1-7), (c) OneStopEnglish (189 texts × 3 levels). CLEAR recommended as primary for hypothesis testing.

  4. FEATURE LANDSCAPE: Feng et al. (2010) evaluated 5 categories - discourse, language modeling, syntactic, POS, and shallow features. Their Table 5 lists 8 shallow features. Critical finding: ALL existing features are means/averages (e.g., 'average syllables per word'). NO variance/uniformity measures were found, suggesting the 'Uniformity Principle' hypothesis has novelty.

  5. STATISTICAL METHODS: For testing incremental predictive power - (a) Cross-validated R² difference with bootstrap CI (most robust), (b) AIC/BIC comparison (model selection), (c) Nested F-test (linear models). Recommendations provided with Python implementation examples.

  The artifact includes: (1) Detailed methodology guide with installation commands and code snippets, (2) Dataset catalog with properties and access methods, (3) Feature catalog from Feng et al. (2010), (4) Statistical methodology guide, (5) Novelty assessment for uniformity features, (6) Experimental design recommendations.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Web research toolkit: web search (Serper/Google), web page fetch as markdown (HTML and PDF), and regex grep over full page/PDF text. Use whenever a task needs to search the web, read a page, mine a paper/PDF, verify citations, or extract exact quotes, numbers, or methodology from a URL."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — Serper.dev for search, html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and
   regex grep over the full document text. They work without any built-in web
   tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (Serper.dev / Google)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. Use it first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Uniformity Improves Sentence Readability
hypothesis: >-
  The readability of a sentence is predicted not only by average linguistic complexity (e.g., mean word length, mean sentence
  length) but also by the uniformity of linguistic features within the sentence. Specifically, sentences with lower coefficient
  of variation (CV) of word-level features—such as word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency—are easier
  to read than sentences with the same average values but higher CV. Initial experiments on 13,129 sentences from WeeBIT and
  CEFR-SP datasets show that adding uniformity features (CV of word length, syllables, frequency) to traditional average features
  yields statistically significant R² improvements of +0.138 (WeeBIT) and +0.042 (CEFR-SP), both p < 0.0001. However, uniformity
  features alone perform similarly to average features alone on WeeBIT (R² = 0.226 vs 0.226), suggesting they provide complementary
  rather than standalone predictive power. The 'Uniformity Principle' operates because uniform information density allows
  readers to establish a consistent processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load. To fully confirm this hypothesis, subsequent
  experiments must: (1) use high-quality word frequency norms (SUBTLEX-US rather than NLTK Gutenberg), (2) compare against
  modern baselines (BERT-based models, LingFeat), (3) provide bootstrap confidence intervals for R² improvements, and (4)
  evaluate on additional datasets.
motivation: >-
  Classic readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) rely exclusively on average values of surface features. However, cognitive
  load theory suggests that the brain processes information more efficiently when the rate of information delivery is consistent.
  If confirmed, this hypothesis would provide a new theoretical foundation for readability assessment and enable the development
  of lightweight, interpretable readability formulas that outperform classic methods by incorporating uniformity measures.
  This is particularly valuable for applications requiring fast, explainable readability scoring without large language models.
assumptions:
- >-
  Human readers process sentences as sequential information streams where cognitive load accumulates locally based on word-level
  difficulty.
- >-
  Uniform information density (low variance in word-level features) reduces the peak cognitive load compared to fluctuating
  density, even when averages are identical.
- >-
  Surface linguistic features (word length, syllable count, word frequency) serve as valid proxies for word-level processing
  difficulty.
- >-
  The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) is an appropriate measure of uniformity that generalizes
  across sentences of different lengths and difficulty levels.
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Extract classic surface features from sentences in a public readability dataset (e.g., CommonLit CLEAR corpus or WSJ
  dataset): word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency for each word. 2. Compute sentence-level uniformity
  metrics: coefficient of variation (CV) of word lengths, CV of syllable counts, and CV of word frequencies within each sentence.
  3. Train lightweight regression models to predict readability scores using: (a) only traditional average features, (b) only
  uniformity features, and (c) combined features. 4. Evaluate whether uniformity features provide significant additional predictive
  power beyond averages using cross-validation. 5. Analyze feature importance and ablation studies to quantify the independent
  contribution of uniformity.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) Uniformity features (CV of word-level features) are statistically significant predictors
  of readability scores (p < 0.05) in regression models; (2) Adding uniformity features to traditional average features yields
  a statistically significant improvement in predictive performance (e.g., R² increase > 0.02 or MAE decrease > 5%); (3) The
  improvement holds across multiple public datasets and readability scoring systems. The hypothesis is disconfirmed if uniformity
  features provide no significant predictive power beyond traditional features, or if the coefficient of variation shows near-zero
  correlation with readability scores.

  Feng et al. (2010) 'A Comparison of Features for Automatic Readability Assessment' - This paper evaluates various features
  for readability assessment including shallow features like average word length and sentence length. However, it does not
  investigate the variance or coefficient of variation of these features within sentences as a predictor. Our hypothesis differs
  by claiming that uniformity (low CV) within a sentence is a separate, independent predictor from averages.
- >-
  Courtis (2004) 'Corporate report obfuscation: artefact or phenomenon?' - This paper uses coefficient of variation to measure

  of word properties improves readability.

  Eltanbouly et al. (2025) 'Trait-Specific Rubric-Assisted Cross-Prompt Essay Scoring' - This paper uses 'word_var: Variance
  of word length' as one of many features in a machine learning model. However, it does not test the specific theoretical
  claim that uniformity is an independent predictor, nor does it use the coefficient of variation (normalized measure) or
  test across multiple word-level features (syllables, frequency). Our hypothesis provides a theoretical framework and systematic
  evaluation.
- >-
  Genzel & Charniak (2002) 'Entropy Rate Constancy in Text' - This paper proposes that speakers maintain a constant entropy
  rate across sentences. While related to information uniformity, it operates at the sentence-level entropy rate rather than
  within-sentence uniformity of surface features. Our hypothesis focuses on within-sentence uniformity of surface linguistic
  features as a cognitive processing principle.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by three cross-domain insights: (1) From COGNITIVE SCIENCE and Cognitive Load Theory: consistent
  information processing rates reduce peak working memory load compared to fluctuating rates. (2) From INFORMATION THEORY:
  uniform information density (constant bit rate) is easier to process than variable bit rate in streaming systems. (3) From
  ECONOMICS: the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation measure inequality/non-uniformity, which in other domains predicts
  system efficiency. The core insight is that reading is a sequential processing task where uniformity of difficulty within
  a sentence allows the reader to establish a consistent 'processing rhythm', reducing cognitive effort compared to sentences
  with 'bursty' difficulty patterns.
terms:
- term: Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  definition: >-
    A normalized measure of dispersion calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (CV = σ/μ). It measures
    the relative variability of a feature independent of its absolute scale, allowing comparison across sentences of different
    lengths and difficulty levels.
- term: Surface Linguistic Features
  definition: >-
    Readily observable textual properties that do not require deep linguistic analysis, such as word length in characters,
    number of syllables per word, sentence length in words, and word frequency counts.
- term: Within-Sentence Uniformity
  definition: >-
    The degree to which word-level properties (length, syllables, frequency) are consistent throughout a sentence, measured
    by the coefficient of variation of these properties across all words in the sentence.
- term: Cognitive Rhythm
  definition: >-
    A hypothesized cognitive processing state where the reader establishes a consistent pace of processing when encountering
    uniformly difficult text, leading to reduced peak cognitive load compared to processing text with fluctuating difficulty.
- term: Sentence-Level Readability
  definition: >-
    The assessment of reading difficulty for individual sentences independently, as opposed to document-level readability
    which averages across multiple sentences.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes that sentence readability depends not only on average linguistic complexity but also on the uniformity
  of word-level features within the sentence. Sentences with consistent word lengths, syllable counts, and word frequencies
  (low coefficient of variation) are predicted to be easier to read because they allow readers to maintain a steady cognitive
  processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load.

title: Word features and readability methods research
summary: |-
  This research artifact provides a comprehensive methodological guide for computing word-level linguistic features (syllable count, word frequency) and understanding the sentence-level readability assessment landscape. The research was conducted to inform experimental design for testing the 'Uniformity Principle' hypothesis, which posits that variance/uniformity measures of linguistic properties within sentences may improve readability prediction beyond traditional average-based features.

  Key findings across 5 research phases:

  1. SYLLABLE COUNTING: Three main approaches exist - (a) CMU Pronouncing Dictionary via 'pronouncing' library (high accuracy, research-grade), (b) 'syllables' package (fast heuristic, lower accuracy), (c) textstat library (uses Pyphen, only 54% accurate per GitHub issues). Recommendation: Use CMUdict as primary with heuristic fallback.

  2. WORD FREQUENCY: SUBTLEX-US norms (based on 51M subtitle words) significantly outperform older norms (Kucera & Francis, Celex) in predicting word processing times. Available as free download from Ghent University. Google Books Ngrams is secondary option.

  3. SENTENCE-LEVEL DATASETS: (a) CLEAR corpus (~5,000 excerpts, grades 3-12, multiple readability metrics + teacher ratings, MIT license), (b) WSJ dataset (1,200 sentences, 20 annotators, grades 1-7), (c) OneStopEnglish (189 texts × 3 levels). CLEAR recommended as primary for hypothesis testing.

  4. FEATURE LANDSCAPE: Feng et al. (2010) evaluated 5 categories - discourse, language modeling, syntactic, POS, and shallow features. Their Table 5 lists 8 shallow features. Critical finding: ALL existing features are means/averages (e.g., 'average syllables per word'). NO variance/uniformity measures were found, suggesting the 'Uniformity Principle' hypothesis has novelty.

  5. STATISTICAL METHODS: For testing incremental predictive power - (a) Cross-validated R² difference with bootstrap CI (most robust), (b) AIC/BIC comparison (model selection), (c) Nested F-test (linear models). Recommendations provided with Python implementation examples.

  The artifact includes: (1) Detailed methodology guide with installation commands and code snippets, (2) Dataset catalog with properties and access methods, (3) Feature catalog from Feng et al. (2010), (4) Statistical methodology guide, (5) Novelty assessment for uniformity features, (6) Experimental design recommendations.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Uniformity Improves Sentence Readability
hypothesis: >-
  The readability of a sentence is predicted not only by average linguistic complexity (e.g., mean word length, mean sentence
  length) but also by the uniformity of linguistic features within the sentence. Specifically, sentences with lower coefficient
  of variation (CV) of word-level features—such as word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency—are easier
  to read than sentences with the same average values but higher CV. Initial experiments on 13,129 sentences from WeeBIT and
  CEFR-SP datasets show that adding uniformity features (CV of word length, syllables, frequency) to traditional average features
  yields statistically significant R² improvements of +0.138 (WeeBIT) and +0.042 (CEFR-SP), both p < 0.0001. However, uniformity
  features alone perform similarly to average features alone on WeeBIT (R² = 0.226 vs 0.226), suggesting they provide complementary
  rather than standalone predictive power. The 'Uniformity Principle' operates because uniform information density allows
  readers to establish a consistent processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load. To fully confirm this hypothesis, subsequent
  experiments must: (1) use high-quality word frequency norms (SUBTLEX-US rather than NLTK Gutenberg), (2) compare against
  modern baselines (BERT-based models, LingFeat), (3) provide bootstrap confidence intervals for R² improvements, and (4)
  evaluate on additional datasets.
motivation: >-
  Classic readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) rely exclusively on average values of surface features. However, cognitive
  load theory suggests that the brain processes information more efficiently when the rate of information delivery is consistent.
  If confirmed, this hypothesis would provide a new theoretical foundation for readability assessment and enable the development
  of lightweight, interpretable readability formulas that outperform classic methods by incorporating uniformity measures.
  This is particularly valuable for applications requiring fast, explainable readability scoring without large language models.
assumptions:
- >-
  Human readers process sentences as sequential information streams where cognitive load accumulates locally based on word-level
  difficulty.
- >-
  Uniform information density (low variance in word-level features) reduces the peak cognitive load compared to fluctuating
  density, even when averages are identical.
- >-
  Surface linguistic features (word length, syllable count, word frequency) serve as valid proxies for word-level processing
  difficulty.
- >-
  The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) is an appropriate measure of uniformity that generalizes
  across sentences of different lengths and difficulty levels.
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Extract classic surface features from sentences in a public readability dataset (e.g., CommonLit CLEAR corpus or WSJ
  dataset): word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency for each word. 2. Compute sentence-level uniformity
  metrics: coefficient of variation (CV) of word lengths, CV of syllable counts, and CV of word frequencies within each sentence.
  3. Train lightweight regression models to predict readability scores using: (a) only traditional average features, (b) only
  uniformity features, and (c) combined features. 4. Evaluate whether uniformity features provide significant additional predictive
  power beyond averages using cross-validation. 5. Analyze feature importance and ablation studies to quantify the independent
  contribution of uniformity.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) Uniformity features (CV of word-level features) are statistically significant predictors
  of readability scores (p < 0.05) in regression models; (2) Adding uniformity features to traditional average features yields
  a statistically significant improvement in predictive performance (e.g., R² increase > 0.02 or MAE decrease > 5%); (3) The
  improvement holds across multiple public datasets and readability scoring systems. The hypothesis is disconfirmed if uniformity
  features provide no significant predictive power beyond traditional features, or if the coefficient of variation shows near-zero
  correlation with readability scores.

  Feng et al. (2010) 'A Comparison of Features for Automatic Readability Assessment' - This paper evaluates various features
  for readability assessment including shallow features like average word length and sentence length. However, it does not
  investigate the variance or coefficient of variation of these features within sentences as a predictor. Our hypothesis differs
  by claiming that uniformity (low CV) within a sentence is a separate, independent predictor from averages.
- >-
  Courtis (2004) 'Corporate report obfuscation: artefact or phenomenon?' - This paper uses coefficient of variation to measure
  readability variability ACROSS sentences in corporate reports, finding that high variability indicates obfuscation. Our

  of word properties improves readability.

  Eltanbouly et al. (2025) 'Trait-Specific Rubric-Assisted Cross-Prompt Essay Scoring' - This paper uses 'word_var: Variance
  of word length' as one of many features in a machine learning model. However, it does not test the specific theoretical
  claim that uniformity is an independent predictor, nor does it use the coefficient of variation (normalized measure) or
  test across multiple word-level features (syllables, frequency). Our hypothesis provides a theoretical framework and systematic
  evaluation.
- >-
  Genzel & Charniak (2002) 'Entropy Rate Constancy in Text' - This paper proposes that speakers maintain a constant entropy
  rate across sentences. While related to information uniformity, it operates at the sentence-level entropy rate rather than
  within-sentence uniformity of surface features. Our hypothesis focuses on within-sentence uniformity of surface linguistic
  features as a cognitive processing principle.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by three cross-domain insights: (1) From COGNITIVE SCIENCE and Cognitive Load Theory: consistent
  information processing rates reduce peak working memory load compared to fluctuating rates. (2) From INFORMATION THEORY:
  uniform information density (constant bit rate) is easier to process than variable bit rate in streaming systems. (3) From
  ECONOMICS: the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation measure inequality/non-uniformity, which in other domains predicts
  system efficiency. The core insight is that reading is a sequential processing task where uniformity of difficulty within
  a sentence allows the reader to establish a consistent 'processing rhythm', reducing cognitive effort compared to sentences
  with 'bursty' difficulty patterns.
terms:
- term: Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  definition: >-
    A normalized measure of dispersion calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (CV = σ/μ). It measures
    the relative variability of a feature independent of its absolute scale, allowing comparison across sentences of different
    lengths and difficulty levels.
- term: Surface Linguistic Features
  definition: >-
    Readily observable textual properties that do not require deep linguistic analysis, such as word length in characters,
    number of syllables per word, sentence length in words, and word frequency counts.
- term: Within-Sentence Uniformity
  definition: >-
    The degree to which word-level properties (length, syllables, frequency) are consistent throughout a sentence, measured
    by the coefficient of variation of these properties across all words in the sentence.
- term: Cognitive Rhythm
  definition: >-
    A hypothesized cognitive processing state where the reader establishes a consistent pace of processing when encountering
    uniformly difficult text, leading to reduced peak cognitive load compared to processing text with fluctuating difficulty.
- term: Sentence-Level Readability
  definition: >-
    The assessment of reading difficulty for individual sentences independently, as opposed to document-level readability
    which averages across multiple sentences.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes that sentence readability depends not only on average linguistic complexity but also on the uniformity
  of word-level features within the sentence. Sentences with consistent word lengths, syllable counts, and word frequencies
  (low coefficient of variation) are predicted to be easier to read because they allow readers to maintain a steady cognitive
  processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load.

  Implement statistical evaluation using the experiment results: (1) Paired Bootstrap Test: Test whether MSE reduction (17.8%
  WeeBIT, 8.9% CEFR-SP) is statistically significant using 10,000 bootstrap samples with p-value computation. (2) Feature
  Coefficient Uncertainty: Bootstrap standard errors and 95% CI for Ridge regression coefficients, identify which uniformity
  features are significant when controlling for others. (3) Proper Reporting: Clearly distinguish training vs test metrics,
  report cross-validated test set results only. (4) Effect Size: Compute Cohen's d for R² improvements, assess practical significance.
  (5) Ablation: Test each uniformity feature individually to identify which contribute uniquely. Generate publication-ready
  tables with mean, SD, CI for all metrics. This addresses major feedback #3 (statistical rigor) and minor feedback #9 (coefficient
  significance).

title: Word features and readability methods research
summary: |-
  This research artifact provides a comprehensive methodological guide for computing word-level linguistic features (syllable count, word frequency) and understanding the sentence-level readability assessment landscape. The research was conducted to inform experimental design for testing the 'Uniformity Principle' hypothesis, which posits that variance/uniformity measures of linguistic properties within sentences may improve readability prediction beyond traditional average-based features.

  Key findings across 5 research phases:

  1. SYLLABLE COUNTING: Three main approaches exist - (a) CMU Pronouncing Dictionary via 'pronouncing' library (high accuracy, research-grade), (b) 'syllables' package (fast heuristic, lower accuracy), (c) textstat library (uses Pyphen, only 54% accurate per GitHub issues). Recommendation: Use CMUdict as primary with heuristic fallback.

  2. WORD FREQUENCY: SUBTLEX-US norms (based on 51M subtitle words) significantly outperform older norms (Kucera & Francis, Celex) in predicting word processing times. Available as free download from Ghent University. Google Books Ngrams is secondary option.

  3. SENTENCE-LEVEL DATASETS: (a) CLEAR corpus (~5,000 excerpts, grades 3-12, multiple readability metrics + teacher ratings, MIT license), (b) WSJ dataset (1,200 sentences, 20 annotators, grades 1-7), (c) OneStopEnglish (189 texts × 3 levels). CLEAR recommended as primary for hypothesis testing.

  4. FEATURE LANDSCAPE: Feng et al. (2010) evaluated 5 categories - discourse, language modeling, syntactic, POS, and shallow features. Their Table 5 lists 8 shallow features. Critical finding: ALL existing features are means/averages (e.g., 'average syllables per word'). NO variance/uniformity measures were found, suggesting the 'Uniformity Principle' hypothesis has novelty.

  5. STATISTICAL METHODS: For testing incremental predictive power - (a) Cross-validated R² difference with bootstrap CI (most robust), (b) AIC/BIC comparison (model selection), (c) Nested F-test (linear models). Recommendations provided with Python implementation examples.

  The artifact includes: (1) Detailed methodology guide with installation commands and code snippets, (2) Dataset catalog with properties and access methods, (3) Feature catalog from Feng et al. (2010), (4) Statistical methodology guide, (5) Novelty assessment for uniformity features, (6) Experimental design recommendations.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Uniformity Improves Sentence Readability
hypothesis: >-
  The readability of a sentence is predicted not only by average linguistic complexity (e.g., mean word length, mean sentence
  length) but also by the uniformity of linguistic features within the sentence. Specifically, sentences with lower coefficient
  of variation (CV) of word-level features—such as word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency—are easier
  to read than sentences with the same average values but higher CV. Initial experiments on 13,129 sentences from WeeBIT and
  CEFR-SP datasets show that adding uniformity features (CV of word length, syllables, frequency) to traditional average features
  yields statistically significant R² improvements of +0.138 (WeeBIT) and +0.042 (CEFR-SP), both p < 0.0001. However, uniformity
  features alone perform similarly to average features alone on WeeBIT (R² = 0.226 vs 0.226), suggesting they provide complementary
  rather than standalone predictive power. The 'Uniformity Principle' operates because uniform information density allows
  readers to establish a consistent processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load. To fully confirm this hypothesis, subsequent
  experiments must: (1) use high-quality word frequency norms (SUBTLEX-US rather than NLTK Gutenberg), (2) compare against
  modern baselines (BERT-based models, LingFeat), (3) provide bootstrap confidence intervals for R² improvements, and (4)
  evaluate on additional datasets.
motivation: >-
  Classic readability formulas (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.) rely exclusively on average values of surface features. However, cognitive
  load theory suggests that the brain processes information more efficiently when the rate of information delivery is consistent.
  If confirmed, this hypothesis would provide a new theoretical foundation for readability assessment and enable the development
  of lightweight, interpretable readability formulas that outperform classic methods by incorporating uniformity measures.
  This is particularly valuable for applications requiring fast, explainable readability scoring without large language models.
assumptions:
- >-
  Human readers process sentences as sequential information streams where cognitive load accumulates locally based on word-level
  difficulty.
- >-
  Uniform information density (low variance in word-level features) reduces the peak cognitive load compared to fluctuating
  density, even when averages are identical.
- >-
  Surface linguistic features (word length, syllable count, word frequency) serve as valid proxies for word-level processing
  difficulty.
- >-
  The coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) is an appropriate measure of uniformity that generalizes
  across sentences of different lengths and difficulty levels.
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Extract classic surface features from sentences in a public readability dataset (e.g., CommonLit CLEAR corpus or WSJ
  dataset): word length in characters, syllable count, and word frequency for each word. 2. Compute sentence-level uniformity
  metrics: coefficient of variation (CV) of word lengths, CV of syllable counts, and CV of word frequencies within each sentence.
  3. Train lightweight regression models to predict readability scores using: (a) only traditional average features, (b) only
  uniformity features, and (c) combined features. 4. Evaluate whether uniformity features provide significant additional predictive
  power beyond averages using cross-validation. 5. Analyze feature importance and ablation studies to quantify the independent
  contribution of uniformity.
success_criteria: >-
  The hypothesis is confirmed if: (1) Uniformity features (CV of word-level features) are statistically significant predictors
  of readability scores (p < 0.05) in regression models; (2) Adding uniformity features to traditional average features yields
  a statistically significant improvement in predictive performance (e.g., R² increase > 0.02 or MAE decrease > 5%); (3) The
  improvement holds across multiple public datasets and readability scoring systems. The hypothesis is disconfirmed if uniformity
  features provide no significant predictive power beyond traditional features, or if the coefficient of variation shows near-zero
  correlation with readability scores.

  Feng et al. (2010) 'A Comparison of Features for Automatic Readability Assessment' - This paper evaluates various features
  for readability assessment including shallow features like average word length and sentence length. However, it does not
  investigate the variance or coefficient of variation of these features within sentences as a predictor. Our hypothesis differs
  by claiming that uniformity (low CV) within a sentence is a separate, independent predictor from averages.

  claim that uniformity is an independent predictor, nor does it use the coefficient of variation (normalized measure) or
  test across multiple word-level features (syllables, frequency). Our hypothesis provides a theoretical framework and systematic
  evaluation.
- >-
  Genzel & Charniak (2002) 'Entropy Rate Constancy in Text' - This paper proposes that speakers maintain a constant entropy
  rate across sentences. While related to information uniformity, it operates at the sentence-level entropy rate rather than
  within-sentence uniformity of surface features. Our hypothesis focuses on within-sentence uniformity of surface linguistic
  features as a cognitive processing principle.
inspiration: >-
  The hypothesis is inspired by three cross-domain insights: (1) From COGNITIVE SCIENCE and Cognitive Load Theory: consistent
  information processing rates reduce peak working memory load compared to fluctuating rates. (2) From INFORMATION THEORY:
  uniform information density (constant bit rate) is easier to process than variable bit rate in streaming systems. (3) From
  ECONOMICS: the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation measure inequality/non-uniformity, which in other domains predicts
  system efficiency. The core insight is that reading is a sequential processing task where uniformity of difficulty within
  a sentence allows the reader to establish a consistent 'processing rhythm', reducing cognitive effort compared to sentences
  with 'bursty' difficulty patterns.
terms:
- term: Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  definition: >-
    A normalized measure of dispersion calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean (CV = σ/μ). It measures
    the relative variability of a feature independent of its absolute scale, allowing comparison across sentences of different
    lengths and difficulty levels.
- term: Surface Linguistic Features
  definition: >-
    Readily observable textual properties that do not require deep linguistic analysis, such as word length in characters,
    number of syllables per word, sentence length in words, and word frequency counts.
- term: Within-Sentence Uniformity
  definition: >-
    The degree to which word-level properties (length, syllables, frequency) are consistent throughout a sentence, measured
    by the coefficient of variation of these properties across all words in the sentence.
- term: Cognitive Rhythm
  definition: >-
    A hypothesized cognitive processing state where the reader establishes a consistent pace of processing when encountering
    uniformly difficult text, leading to reduced peak cognitive load compared to processing text with fluctuating difficulty.
- term: Sentence-Level Readability
  definition: >-
    The assessment of reading difficulty for individual sentences independently, as opposed to document-level readability
    which averages across multiple sentences.
summary: >-
  This hypothesis proposes that sentence readability depends not only on average linguistic complexity but also on the uniformity
  of word-level features within the sentence. Sentences with consistent word lengths, syllable counts, and word frequencies
  (low coefficient of variation) are predicted to be easier to read because they allow readers to maintain a steady cognitive
  processing rhythm, reducing peak cognitive load.

  Implement statistical evaluation using the experiment results: (1) Paired Bootstrap Test: Test whether MSE reduction (17.8%
  WeeBIT, 8.9% CEFR-SP) is statistically significant using 10,000 bootstrap samples with p-value computation. (2) Feature
  Coefficient Uncertainty: Bootstrap standard errors and 95% CI for Ridge regression coefficients, identify which uniformity

  report cross-validated test set results only. (4) Effect Size: Compute Cohen's d for R² improvements, assess practical significance.
  (5) Ablation: Test each uniformity feature individually to identify which contribute uniquely. Generate publication-ready
  tables with mean, SD, CI for all metrics. This addresses major feedback #3 (statistical rigor) and minor feedback #9 (coefficient

title: Word features and readability methods research
summary: |-
  This research artifact provides a comprehensive methodological guide for computing word-level linguistic features (syllable count, word frequency) and understanding the sentence-level readability assessment landscape. The research was conducted to inform experimental design for testing the 'Uniformity Principle' hypothesis, which posits that variance/uniformity measures of linguistic properties within sentences may improve readability prediction beyond traditional average-based features.

  Key findings across 5 research phases:

  1. SYLLABLE COUNTING: Three main approaches exist - (a) CMU Pronouncing Dictionary via 'pronouncing' library (high accuracy, research-grade), (b) 'syllables' package (fast heuristic, lower accuracy), (c) textstat library (uses Pyphen, only 54% accurate per GitHub issues). Recommendation: Use CMUdict as primary with heuristic fallback.

  2. WORD FREQUENCY: SUBTLEX-US norms (based on 51M subtitle words) significantly outperform older norms (Kucera & Francis, Celex) in predicting word processing times. Available as free download from Ghent University. Google Books Ngrams is secondary option.

  3. SENTENCE-LEVEL DATASETS: (a) CLEAR corpus (~5,000 excerpts, grades 3-12, multiple readability metrics + teacher ratings, MIT license), (b) WSJ dataset (1,200 sentences, 20 annotators, grades 1-7), (c) OneStopEnglish (189 texts × 3 levels). CLEAR recommended as primary for hypothesis testing.

  4. FEATURE LANDSCAPE: Feng et al. (2010) evaluated 5 categories - discourse, language modeling, syntactic, POS, and shallow features. Their Table 5 lists 8 shallow features. Critical finding: ALL existing features are means/averages (e.g., 'average syllables per word'). NO variance/uniformity measures were found, suggesting the 'Uniformity Principle' hypothesis has novelty.

  5. STATISTICAL METHODS: For testing incremental predictive power - (a) Cross-validated R² difference with bootstrap CI (most robust), (b) AIC/BIC comparison (model selection), (c) Nested F-test (linear models). Recommendations provided with Python implementation examples.

  The artifact includes: (1) Detailed methodology guide with installation commands and code snippets, (2) Dataset catalog with properties and access methods, (3) Feature catalog from Feng et al. (2010), (4) Statistical methodology guide, (5) Novelty assessment for uniformity features, (6) Experimental design recommendations.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>

<compute_profiles>
Choose the compute profile this artifact needs for execution.
Available profiles for experiment artifacts:
  - gpu: 1x NVIDIA RTX A4500, 20GB VRAM, 7 vCPUs, 29GB RAM — ML training, CUDA, large models (fallback: GPUs cheap→expensive: 2000 Ada → A4000 → 4000 Ada → L4 → 4090 → 5090)
  - cpu_heavy: 4 vCPUs, 32GB RAM — large datasets, memory-intensive processing (fallback: CPUs cheap→expensive, then GPU hosts cheap→expensive (all ≥32GB RAM))

Set runpod_compute_profile to one of these exact tier names.
</compute_profiles>
GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Hypothesis Selection & Evaluation:**
- `sel_hypo_out.json` - Hypothesis Selection output (all hypotheses with selected flags)
- `feasibility_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with feasibility scores
- `feasibility_eval_top.json` - Top 5 most feasible hypotheses
- `novelty_research_one.json` - Single hypothesis novelty research arguments with citations
- `novelty_eval_all.json` - All hypotheses with novelty scores
- `novelty_eval_top.json` - Single best selected hypothesis

**Experiment Pipeline:**
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
